# OldBlock Edition

**OldBlock Edition** is a faithful recreation of **Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.1.x** built on the [Luanti/Minetest](https://www.luanti.org) engine.  
The project’s goal is to replicate the look, feel, and gameplay of the very first public MCPE versions (0.1.0–0.1.2), while remaining open-source and moddable.

## ✨ Features

- Finite 256×256 worlds, height 64 (like MCPE 0.1.x)  
- Rolling plains with oak trees, sand patches, and puddles  
- Simplified creative-only gameplay  
- Instant block breaking (no drops)  
- Three-slot hotbar (preloaded with blocks)  
- No survival elements (no hearts, hunger, or damage)  
- Nostalgic pixel textures (Pixel Perfection & custom work)  
- World border enforced to stay true to early MCPE limits

## 📦 Included Blocks & Items (0.1.x set)

- Stone, cobblestone, dirt, sand, gravel  
- Grass block (colorized overlay)  
- Oak logs, planks, leaves, saplings  
- Wool (16 colors)  
- Glass, bookshelf  
- Bedrock, TNT (placeholder, non-functional)
